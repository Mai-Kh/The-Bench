  <h1 class="center"> About </h1>
  <p class="center" style="color:black"> The Bench is community that aims at producing art which challenges, evokes and inquires. This community was first brought together in 2015 by a group of like-minded friends and artists who sought to create a community to foster eachother's creative potential, and in its early forms was simply those friends meeting together in the basement of their favorite bar to share, critique, and comment on eachother's work. The Bench continued to grow with each passing meeting, as new members would stop by to join in the fun and craft. After realizing the potential and need to showcase the work of its artists, The Bench began holding "salons" as they call them. These are shows held a few times a year in disparate interesting locations such as home, clubs, museums, and bars, where the artists are invited to showcase their work for an assembled audience. In this way, The Bench interacts with the community and helps itself grow. The Bench now functions with the help of students from another generation and is growing constantly. Let's make greater art, together.</p>
